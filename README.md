**YambaCodeMidi API ~ aka "Y"-"PI".**

***Creative and recreational fun!***

In honour of PI day somewhere around 2016. 
This is an archived entry from my weekend coding leasures in the past. 

This is a simple app utilising JDKs MIDI support.
To the joy of those of us technical and mathematically inclined music geeks. :)

Adapting this to a more intuitive DSL-like
syntax using builder pattern chained idioms.

To run examples go to src/test
You may have to turn speakers way up.

There is a bug I left insde the code,
that I left intentionally.
It will be interesting from a music theoretical perspective..
Clue: 'diatonic' vs 'chromatic', transpose...

Enjoy.
And, happy Pi day (every day, but 14:th of march in particular).
